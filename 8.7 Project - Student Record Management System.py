#Project: Student Record Management System

# 1. Create tuples to store student information (name, age, grade).
student_names = ("Christina", "Bobby", "Danniel", "Alice", "John")
student_ages = ("31", "28", "24", "22", "30")
student_grades = ("A", "C", "B", "A", "B")

# 2. Use tuple methods to count and index elements.
grade_count = student_grades.count("B")
print(f"This is {student_names[1]} aged {student_ages[1]}. Their test result was a B.")

# 3. Create sets to store unique student IDs and courses.

# 4. Perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

# 5. Use frozen sets to create immutable sets of student data.
