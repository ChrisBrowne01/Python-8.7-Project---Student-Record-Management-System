#Project: Student Record Management System

# 1. Create tuples to store student information (name, age, grade).
student_name = ("Christina", "Bobby", "Danniel")
student_age = ("31", "28", "24")
student_grade = ("A", "C", "B")

# 2. Use tuple methods to count and index elements.

# 3. Create sets to store unique student IDs and courses.

# 4. Perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

# 5. Use frozen sets to create immutable sets of student data.
